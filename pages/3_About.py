st.markdown('# Apartment search Lyon')
st.markdown("""ðŸ‘‹ Hi, my name is [Sorin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sorinbiriescu/). \
I made this to help me with my current search for an apartment in Lyon by using \
data to get the best price to value ratio, showcase and develop new analytical, \
statistical analysis and machine learning skills through a practical project. Also, \
I'm not a huge fan of constantly being served with ads for overpriced claustrophobic \
new developments ðŸ™„. I want to be in charge of what data I see in front of my eyes. 

The project has 3 main parts:
1. Filtering and showing results with info and new features (such as price evolution)
2. Analysis of filtered results for quick overview of price distribution, \
    total count etc.
3. Global analysis which takes all the data in the DB \
    in order to produce long-term analytics, such as price evolution in \
    a particular zone with confidence intervals and testing different hypothesis \
    (is an apartment sold by an agency more expensive than one sold by a \
    private individual ? etc.).

The last two need to be activated manually by selecting the checkbox before \
the section, like **Show results** below. This is done to avoid unnecessary \
calculations when not needed.

Please note that the scope of this project is limited, mostly to help me \
get an aproximate idea of what's going on in the market right now and to put in practice\
what I learned. This is by no means intended to be an exhaustive tool / analysis.
